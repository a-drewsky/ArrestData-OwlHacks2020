                    Sphere of influence is a term used to discribe the power or influence a country has over neighboring
                    countries.
                    In much the same way, incarceration impacts much more than just the arrestee.
                    When someone is incarcerated and can't post bail, it impacts that person's friends and seriously
                    impacts their family.
                    In this simulation, each family has a normal distribution of family members based on census data and
                    each person has a normal distribution of friends with a mean of 5.
                    When someone is arrested this directly impacts the negative influence on their family and each
                    person with negative influence also slightly impacts their friends.
                    <br /><br />
                    The negative influence a person has is visualized by how red they are. The more negative influence a
                    person has, the more it slows down their life.
                    This simulation shows just how many people are negatively impacted when someone is arrested and is
                    unable to post bail.

                    This simulation is based on census data and arrest data for The City of Philadelphia in the year 2020. Data was
                    provided by Philly Bail Fund. The
                    number of records used is scaled, based on the selected population size.
                    Since this is a scaled down representation of the Philadelphia population, there is a correlated
                    number of records used which are chosen at random.
                    <br /><br />
                    The simulation starts at the beginning of 2020, each time an arrest was made where the arrestee
                    was unable to post bail, a person in the simulation is set as arrested
                    and their level of negative influence is set to 100%. For 100 days after the arrest, the level of
                    negative influence for each family member is increase at a decreasing rate,
                    resulting in about a 50% increase in negative influence over that time.
                    The level of negative influence for each member of the population is set to be no less than half of
                    whichever friend has the most negative influence.
